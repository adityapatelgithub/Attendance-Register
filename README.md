# Attendance-Register
The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Python Tkinter library by creating a attendance register GUI.
In order to use this register: 
1) Clone this repository. 
2) Then add name, student ID, and email (separated by comma) to names.txt. You need to add names of eleven student.
3) In Images folder, add images of your student. Name of image should be name of student (as written in names.txt file) and the type should be .gif. If you dont have images, add a dummy image and name it after your student (otherwise program would crash).

(Note: Soon, I would modify this program so that an excel sheet is modified when you are done taking attendance)
