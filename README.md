# Attendance-Register
The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Python Tkinter library by creating a attendance register GUI.
In order to use this register: 
1) Clone this repository. 
2) Then add name, student ID, and email (separated by comma) to names.txt. You need to add names of eleven student.
3) In Images folder, add images of your student. Name of image should be name of student (as written in names.txt file) and the type should be .gif. Do not delete default.gif in the Images folder (it would be used if you don't add image of your student).
